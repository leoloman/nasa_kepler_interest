# Predicting NASA Kepler Objects of Interest

I will utilise the data retrieved from the NASA API to predict whether a Kepler Object of Interest is a: 'False Positive', 'Candidate' or 'Positive'; in regards to containing a solar system or exoplanet. This will be extremely useful for scientists/astronomers who may want to look further into specific kepler objects of interest and want to determine whether or it the object would be worth investigating.

What this means is that whether a light source observed by the Kepler Telescope is a star with an actual solar systems and should be investigated as to whether there is a planet which is potentially habitable.
